# Astroline
Top-down 2D game, made in Unity.

# Objective
Develop a top down 2D game, using Unity, to learn about some topics that I didn't experience before, such as shaders and the particle system.

# Game Setup
The game proposal is to be a space shooter, top down, where the user moves its spaceship across the screen to kill its enemies before they can touch the player's ship.

# Configurations
The computer used to develop this game was a Acer Nitro 5, with a Intel I7 7700H processor, a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1050Ti and 16Gb of RAM. The  project begun its development using the 2019.3 Unity version.

# Feedback
Any feedbacks and suggestions are apreciated. All I ask is respect :)

# Portfolio
